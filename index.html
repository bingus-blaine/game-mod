<center> <h1> Welcome to 
  <b> BADLAND </b> 
  </h1> 
<h3> <b> Objective </b> </h3>
   <p> Get to the survior sanctuary with your group, but avoid being attacked by raiders, mutants, and losing your items to the elements </p>
<h3> Gameplay </h3>
  <p> Rounds consist of two phases: the Scavenge phase and the Travel phase. The Scavenge phase is the period in which players gather and replenish their resources. The Travel phase consists of random events and movement across the board. </p>
<h3> Scavenge Phase </h3>
  <p> At the beginning of the game, each player draws five resource cards. Each color corresponds to a different resource. The corresponding colors are as follows:
    <ol> <b> Green: Food; Blue: Water; Orange: Fire; Yellow: Armor; Red: First-Aid; Purple: Stamina </b> </ol>  
    <ol> Aside from the first Scavenge phase, which only consists of the intial resource gathering, each subsequent Scavenge phase plays out as such: </ol>
    <ol> 1. Each player draws one resource from the stockpile. Additional resources are drawn corresponding to the number of stamina (purple) blocks each player has (if a player has two purple blocks, he/she draws two extra cards). </ol>
    <ol> 2. By the end of the Scavenge phase, one water (blue) must be discarded for each living survivor. If someone does not drink water, he/she dies. </ol>
    <ol> 3. By the end of the Scavenge phase, one food (green) must be discarded for each living survivor. If someone does not eat food, he/she dies. </ol>  
    <ol> 4. <b> One </b> fire card must be discarded for the entire group. If it is a double fire card, it lasts two turns. In-use double fire cards are still part of the player's inventory. </ol>  
    <ol> 5. If a player is wounded, he/she must be healed by the end of the Scavenge phase. If he/she is not healed, he/she dies. If a player died during the last travel phase, a double first aid card may revive him/her, but <b> only </b> if that person was killed in the last travel phase. </ol>  
    <ol> 6. At the end of the Scavenge phase, players may have no more than <b> SIX </b> items in their inventories. </ol>
    <ol> 7. Items with double blocks can be used as two resources (a double green card may be used to feed two people), but they still count as one item each. The entire item must be used; it cannot be split in half.
<h3> Travel Phase </h3>
  <p> Shuffle any cards that are not possessed by players back into the deck at the beginning of each Travel phase. For this phase, each card becomes a random event, based on the color and number of each card. </p>
    <p> The random event values are as follows: </p>
  <ol> <b> Red: Mutant Attack </b> 1 = Take 1 damage; 2 = Take 2 damage (see <b> combat </b> below) </ol>
  <ol> <b> Orange: Peddler </b> 1 = Trade a single supply for a single supply; 2 = Trade a single supply for a double supply </ol>
  <ol> <b> Yellow: Raiders </b> 1 = Lose an item; 2 = Lose all your items </ol>    
  <ol> <b> Green: Oasis </b> 1 = Draw a random supply; 2 = Everyone draws a random supply </ol>
  <ol> <b> Blue: Storm </b> 1 = Lose all your fire - if you have no fire, become wounded; 2 = Lose all your stamina - if you have no stamina, become wounded </ol>
  <ol> <b> Purple: Outpost </b> 1 = Sacrifice a group member; 2 = Heal and revive everybody. </ol>
    <p> The Travel phase plays out as such: </p>
    <ol> 1. Add up everybody's stamina points. Advance the group that many tiles down the board. </ol>
    <ol> 2. The <b> 1 value </b> of whatever color tile the group lands on is instantly applied to everyone (for example, landing on a red tile means everyone takes 1 damage). </ol>
    <ol> 3. Starting with the person to the left of the one who ended the <b> last </b> Travel phase, survivors draw event cards clockwise. One event card is drawn for each tile moved during that Travel phase.
    <ol> 4. Event cards are applied immediately.
    <ol> 5. When the last event card is drawn, the Travel phase ends and the next Scavenge phase begins.
<h3> Combat </h3>
        <ol> If a player is attacked by a mutant, he/she may use armor (yellow) to block it. </ol>
        <ol> Two armor squares will block a level 2 mutant and one armor square will block a level 1 mutant. If a mutant is blocked, the armor is discarded. </ol>
        <ol> If a player cannot block, he/she becomes wounded or dies. 1 damage will cause wounds, while 2 damage will cause death. If a player takes 1 damage while wounded, he/she dies.
        <ol> If a player uses a single armor to block a level 2 mutant, the player takes 1 damage. If a player uses a double armor to block a level 1 mutant, he/she takes no damage and the armor remains, but the mutant goes on to attack the survivor sitting to the left of the player. </ol>
