<center> <h1> Welcome to 
  <b> BADLAND </b> 
  </h1> 
<center> <h3> <b> Objective </b> </h3>
   <p> Get to the survior sanctuary with your group, but avoid being attacked by raiders, mutants, and losing your items to the elements </p>
<center> <h3> Gameplay </h3>
  <p> Rounds consist of two phases: the Scavenge phase and the Travel phase. The Scavenge phase is the period in which players gather and replenish their resources. The Travel phase consists of random events and movement across the board. </p>
<center> <h3> Scavenge Phase </h3>
  <p> At the beginning of the game, each player draws five resource cards. Each color corresponds to a different resource. The corresponding colors are as follows:
    <ol> <b> Green: Food; Blue: Water; Orange: Fire; Yellow: Armor; Red: First-Aid; Purple: Stamina </b> </ol>  
<ol> Aside from the first Scavenge phase, which only consists of the intial resource gathering, each subsequent Scavenge phase plays out as such: </ol>
<ol> 1. Each player draws one resource from the stockpile. Additional resources are drawn corresponding to the number of stamina (purple) blocks each player has (if a player has two purple blocks, he/she draws two extra cards). </ol>
<ol> 2. By the end of the Scavenge phase, one water (blue) must be discarded for each living survivor. If someone does not drink water, he/she dies. </ol>
<ol> 3. By the end of the Scavenge phase, one food (green) must be discarded for each living survivor. If someone does not eat food, he/she dies. </ol>  
<ol> 4. <b> One </b> fire card must be discarded for the entire group. If it is a double fire card, it lasts two turns. In-use double fire cards can can still be affected by random events. </ol>  
<ol> 5. If a player is wounded, he/she must be healed by the end of the Scavenge phase. If he/she is not healed, he/she dies. If a player died during the last travel phase, a double first aid card may revive him/her, but <b> only </b> if that person was killed in the last travel phase. </ol>  
<ol> 6. At the end of the Scavenge phase, players may have no more than <b> SIX </b> items in their inventories. </ol>
  <center> <h3> Travel Phase </h3>
<p> Shuffle any cards that are not possessed by players back into the deck at the beginning of each Travel phase. For this phase, each card becomes a random event, based on the color and number of each card. The random event values are as follows: </p>
    <ol> <b> Red: Mutant Attack! </b> 1 = 1 damage, 2 = 2 damage (see <b> combat </b> below); </ol>
